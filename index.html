				<h1>A little bit about me.</h1>
				<p>A Chicago native, or more accurately from the home of Ovaltine USA and Portillo's Restaurants: Villa Park, Ill. Farther, my family were Slovakian immigrants who arrived at Ellis Island determined to succeed in this new land of opportunity.


				In my next position, I learned the fundamentals of press production and different types of forward printing. This is an industry that’s reinvented itself in astonishing leaps and bounds, becoming “greener” and more cost-effective within a few short years.

				As industries develop and grow in new directions, I’ll continue learning new ways to design my view of the world and myself.</p>

				<h3>My first design job.</h3>
				<p>In my first job as a professional designer for a large pharmaceutical company, I learned that design is the cornerstone of good communication. Although my responsibilities were limited to in-house graphic design and creating direct mail materials, this experience was great training and an important step towards design, budgeting, and management.</p>
